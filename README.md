# DEPRECATED

NOTE: This version of Tallypay is now deprecated. This (old) version uses our old API, so results may be inaccurate or not return any useful data and may stop functioning in future.

The new version is available at https://tallycoin.app/plugin/

We will still keep old legacy code available here.

# Tallycoin Bitcoin Fundraising

Tallycoin (at https://tallyco.in/) is a non-custodial Bitcoin fundraising platform.

One component of the website is the payment plugin named Tallypay.

## Tallypay

Tallypay is an independent website plug-in that hooks in to the Tallycoin API. You will need an account via https://tallyco.in/ to enter your Bitcoin and Lightning Network payment information.

You can add Tallypay to your website to receive donations.

1. Add the following to the &lt;head&gt; tag of your website (only once).
  
`<script src="tallypay.js" type="text/javascript"></script>`
 
2. Add the following to the main body of your website.

`<div class="tallypay" data-user="yourUsername"></div>`

### Advanced Options

The plug-in looks at the data-* attributes to determine what to do.

Eg #1, data-user="yourUsername" will retrieve information about your account.

Eg #2, data-fundid="" is optional and specifies any of your fundraisers set by data-fundid="fundraiser_id".

`<div class="tallypay" data-user="yourUsername" data-fundid="fundraiser_id" ></div>`

### Callback

When a payment has been made, it is possible for the plug-in to call an external function specified in the data-onpayment attribute.

An array will be returned to your function eg, ['satoshi_amount' => 1000, 'payment_method' => 'lightning']

`<div class="tallypay" data-user="yourUsername" data-onpayment="payment_success_function"></div>`

### Theme

Don't like the default light theme? You can add the data-theme="dark" attribute.

`<div class="tallypay" data-user="yourUsername" data-theme="dark"></div>`

### Make It a Button

By default, the plug-in will appear as a panel (same as the preview image above). To use a small button instead, add the data-size="button" attribute.

When using a button, the button text must also be specified with the data-button_text="some text" attribute.

`<div class="tallypay" data-user="yourUsername" data-size="button" data-button_text="Buy Me a Coffee" ></div>`

### Make It an Image

If you want to use your own image, add the data-image="{your image location}" attribute.

`<div class="tallypay" data-user="yourUsername" data-image="https://yourdomain.com/imgsource.jpg" ></div>`
